#  Neural Network in Python

An implementation to create and train a simple neural network in python - just to learn the basics of how neural networks work. 

Run the full example:

```bash
# Create virtual environment (Tested with Python 3.10)
python -m venv venv
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the example
python mnist.py
python boston.py
```

## Usage

## MNIST Dataset Example

Create a tuple of layers where each element is a tuple as well

The first element of this tuple needs to be the actual layer, and the second element needs to be the activation function applied to the layer

```python
from nn.layer import Dense
from nn.activation import ReLU, Sigmoid

layers = (
    (Dense(64), ReLU()),
    (Dense(64), ReLU()),
    (Dense(1), Sigmoid())
)
```

The model can then be created using the NeuralNetwork class

```python
from nn.loss import BinaryCrossEntropy
from nn.model import NeuralNetwork

model = NeuralNetwork(
    loss=BinaryCrossEntropy(),
    optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.01),
    regularization_factor=2.0,
)
```

The model can then be trained:

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, verbose=True)
```

## Training Loop

The training loop is in the `fit` method in `NeuralNetwork`:

```python
class NeuralNetwork(Model):
    ...

    def fit(self, examples, labels, epochs):
        self._input = examples

        for epoch in range(1, epochs + 1):
            _ = self(self._input) # [1]
            loss = self._loss(self._output, labels) # [2]
            self.backward_step(labels) # [3]
            self.update() # [4]
    ...
```

At the moment, one iteration is on the entire training set and mini-batch is not implemented.
In each iteration, we take a forward pass through the model `self(self._input)`.
Then loss is computed. Loss computation is only necessary if you plan to use the loss in some way - eg. log the loss.

The backward pass `self.backward_step(labels)` goes from the output layer, all the way
back to the inputs to compute gradients for all the learnable parameters. Once this is done,
we can update the learnable parameters with the `self.update()` method.

### 1. Forward Pass

Forward pass is executed when the model instance is called:

```python
class NeuralNetwork(Model):
    ...
    def __call__(self, input_tensor):
        if self._num_examples is None:
            self._num_examples = input_tensor.shape[-1]

        output = input_tensor

        for layer, activation in self._layers:
            output = layer(output)
            output = activation(output)

        self._output = output
        return self._output
    ...
```

The tuple of layers in the `self._layers` parameter is actually a tuple of tuples where
each tuple has a layer (e.g. Dense), and an activation (e.g. ReLU).

### 2. Compute Loss

A loss function is required when instantiating the model. The loss function must implement the `ILoss` protocol
which returns computed loss when the loss function instance is called.

### 3. Backward Pass

Backward pass computes gradients for all learnable parameters of the model:

```python
class NeuralNetwork(Model):
    ...
    def backward_step(self, labels: np.ndarray):
        da = self._loss.gradient(self._output, labels)

        for index in reversed(range(0, self._num_layers)):
            layer, activation = self._layers[index]

            if index == 0:
                prev_layer_output = self._input
            else:
                prev_layer, prev_activation = self._layers[index - 1]
                prev_layer_output = prev_activation(prev_layer.output)

            dz = np.multiply(da, activation.gradient(layer.output))
            layer.grad_weights = np.dot(dz, np.transpose(prev_layer_output)) / self._num_examples
            layer.grad_weights = layer.grad_weights + \
                (self._regularization_factor / self._num_examples) * layer.weights
            layer.grad_bias = np.mean(dz, axis=1, keepdims=True)
            da = np.dot(np.transpose(layer.grad_weights), dz)

            self._optimizer.layer_number = index
            self._optimizer.update_weights(layer, layer.grad_weights)
            self._optimizer.update_bias(layer, layer.grad_bias)
    ...
```

After calculating gradients from the loss function, we iterate over the layers
backwards all the way to the input to compute the gradients for all learnable parameters.
The computed gradients for each layer are stored in the layer instance itself - i.e
`layer.grad_weights` and `layer.grad_bias`.

When the loop reaches the first layer, there is no previous output to it. Therefore, we set
`prev_layer_output` to `self._input` - i.e. the input to the model, the examples

`self._optimizer.layer_number = index`: This line sets the `layer_number` attribute of the optimizer to the current index. The `layer_number` attribute is used by the optimizer to keep track of the current layer being updated during the backward step.

`self._optimizer.update_weights(layer, layer.grad_weights)`: This line calls the `update_weights` method of the optimizer and passes the current layer and its corresponding gradient of weights (`layer.grad_weights`) as arguments. The optimizer uses this information to update the weights of the layer based on its specific optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, RMSprop).

`self._optimizer.update_bias(layer, layer.grad_bias)`: This line calls the `update_bias` method of the optimizer and passes the current layer and its corresponding gradient of biases (`layer.grad_bias`) as arguments. The optimizer uses this information to update the biases of the layer based on its specific optimization algorithm.

### 4. Update the Parameters

Finally, the learnable parameters (weights and biases) are updated based on its specific optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, RMSprop):

```python
class NeuralNetwork(Model):
    ...
    for ln in range(0, len(self._layers)):
            self._optimizer.layer_number = ln
            self._layers[ln][0].update(self._optimizer)
    ...
```

Similarly run the boston.py using
```bash
python boston.py
```

## Development

Currently tested with `python=3.10`. Tests for the `nn` module are available in `./tests` and can be run with `python -m unittest ./tests -v`. Linted with `black .`.

## Next Steps

2. Learning rate scheduler callback
3. Way to implement non trainable layers like Dropout
4. Way to save and load model parameters
